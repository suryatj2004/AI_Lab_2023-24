### DATE: 21/03/2025                                                   
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040168

### AIM: 
To write a prolog program to find the answer of query. 

###  Algorithm:
 Step 1: Start the program <br> 
 Step 2: Convert the sentence into First order Logic  <br> 
 Step 3:  Convert the sentence into Horn clause form  <br> 
 Step 4: Add rules and predicates in a program   <br> 
 Step 5:  Pass the query to program. <br> 
 Step 6: Prolog interpreter shows the output and return answer. <br> 
 Step 8:  Stop the program.

### Program:

### Task 1:
Construct the FOL representation for the following sentences <br> 
1.	John likes all kinds of food.  <br> 
2.	Apples are food.  <br> 
3.	Chicken is a food.  <br> 
4.	Sue eats everything Bill eats. <br> 
5.	 Bill eats peanuts  <br> 
   Convert into clause form and Prove that John like Apple by using Prolog. <br> 

### Program:
```
likes(john,X):-food(X).
eats(sue,X):-eats(bill,X).
eats(bill,peanuts).
food(apple).
food(peanuts).
food(chicken).
```
### Output:

### Task 2:
Consider the following facts and represent them in predicate form: <br>              
1.	Steve likes easy courses. <br> 
2.	Science courses are hard. <br> 
3. All the courses in Have fun department are easy <br> 
4. BK301 is Have fun department course.<br> 
Convert the facts in predicate form to clauses and then prove by resolution: “Steve likes BK301 course”<br> 

### Program:
```
likes(steve, X) :- easy(X).
hard(X) :- science_course(X).
easy(X) :- have_fun_department_course(X).
have_fun_department_course(bk301).
```
### Output:

### Task 3:
Consider the statement <br> 
1.“This is a crime for an American to sell weapons to hostile nations. The Nano , enemy of America has some missiles and its missiles were sold it by Colonal West who is an American” <br> 
Convert to Clause form and prove west is criminal by using Prolog.<br> 
### Program:
```
crime(X):-american(X),
    	  weapon(Y),
    	  hostile(Z),
          sells(X,Y,Z).
sells(west,Y,nano):-missile(Y),
    				owns(nano,Y).
hostile(Z):-enemy(Z,D).
weapon(Y):-missile(Y).
american(west).
enemy(nano,american).
owns(nano,m1).
missile(m1).
```
### Output:

### Result:
Thus the prolog programs were executed successfully and the answer of query was found.
